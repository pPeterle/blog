# About

I'm Pedro Peterle, and I’ve been working in programming since 2018. Over the years, I’ve gained experience with a variety of technologies, including Java, Kotlin, JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, Flutter, and mobile development, among others.

The purpose of this blog is to document everything I’m currently working on, allowing me to track my progress over time. Here, I’ll be sharing not only technical content but also my thoughts on philosophy, religion, and other topics that interest me.

You can follow me on X, where I post daily about my work and the latest tech news.
